		"mission": "I am a seasoned UX developer / designer with experience architecting user focused solutions and leading development teams in the execution. I have a solid understanding of user-centered application design, pragmatic coding practices. I have a soft spot for team building, mentoring, refactoring large codebases and UX/UI architecture.",
		"skills": "I have passion for user focused design, information architecture, UI performance, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Also, I like tools like Gruntjs, Bower, Powershell, Sublime text, Node, Wordpress, Drupal.",
		"quote": "I am obsessed with building things: Teams, UI, UX, lego robots, office supply sculptures, you name it. My sweet spot is somewhere between art, design and development. I'd love to wear bigger leadership pants. I suspect though, that I would miss getting my hands in the code.",
