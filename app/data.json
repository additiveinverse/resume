		"mission": "I am a seasoned UX developer and designer. I live and die by user-centered application design and pragmatic coding practices. I have a soft spot for team building, mentoring, and UX/UI architecture. I am a bit of a mad scientist.",
		"skills": "I know my way around UX design principles, information architecture, front end performance, HTML5, CSS3 and a few javascript frameworks. I've built things using Angular, Wordpress, CraftCMS, and Drupal; using tools like Grunt, Bower, Powershell, Sublime text, Node.  Most of all, I like solving problems.",
		"quote": "Developing people, process and products are my passion. I love working closer to the top of the stack. I've lead enterprise UI teams with a lean startup mentality. I've spent some time in the creative salt mines of an agency environment. I've had a couple years of leadership and UI architecture under my belt. I like what those things have done to my brain.",
