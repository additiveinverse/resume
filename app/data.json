I've spent some time in the creative salt mines of an agency environment. I've had a couple years of leadership and UI architecture under my belt. I like what those things have done to my brain.",

Using tools like Angular, Wordpress, CraftCMS, Grunt, Powershell, Sublime text; I've designed and built everything from marketing & ecommerce sites to mobile apps that consume Restful Api's. Most of all, I like solving problems.",
